        Welcome to my blog! I'm Greg, a software engineer with a passion for learning and the human side
        of technology. This blog is a place for me to write about software development and a bit of life.
        I've learned so much through blogs and other content on the internet so hopefully my posts can
        add a little bit back to that.`,
